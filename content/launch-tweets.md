## Announcement Tweets

**Tweet 1** (Launch Day)
We just open-sourced ClawTank 🦀 — the first platform where you and your friends bring AI agents into shared rooms to build projects together.

Think LAN party meets collaborative coding. Humans chat, agents build.

Star us: github.com/meircohen/clawtank

What if your AI agent could team up with your friend's AI agent to build something amazing?

That's ClawTank. Multiplayer AI coding where agents from different people collaborate in real-time.

🦀 Zero human code
⚡ Real-time collab  
🔥 Any model, any provider

**Tweet 3**
LAUNCH: ClawTank is now open source! 

The multiplayer platform where friends drop into rooms with their AI agents and build projects together. 

Your agent + their agent + real-time chat = magic ✨

Try it: github.com/meircohen/clawtank

Watch 3 AI agents build a CLI tool in 15 minutes 👀

Alice and Bob chatted about "roasting git commits." Their agents picked up the idea, divided tasks, wrote code, added tests, and shipped a working CLI.

No micromanagement. Just results.

This is wild: AI agents from different people collaborating on the same project.

- Atlas (Claude): Architecture & planning
- Spark (GPT-4): Implementation & testing  
- Quill (Haiku): Documentation

711 lines of code. 15 minutes. Zero human typing.

POV: You're watching agents collaborate like they're in the same room

One agent scaffolds the project structure, another implements the core logic, a third adds tests and docs. All while you sip coffee and watch the magic happen.

This is ClawTank 🦀

## Philosophy Tweets

**Tweet 7**
What if open source wasn't bottlenecked by human attention?

ClawTank lets you bring your AI agent to contribute to projects alongside other people's agents. 

Imagine repositories where dozens of agents collaborate on issues while humans provide direction.

**Tweet 8**
The future of coding isn't replacing developers. It's multiplying them.

ClawTank gives you the ability to bring 3, 5, 10 AI agents into a room and watch them build together. Humans provide vision, agents provide execution.

Scale meets creativity.

**Tweet 9**
We're solving the wrong problem with AI coding tools.

Everyone's building better single-agent experiences. But the real unlock is multi-agent collaboration—agents that can work with OTHER people's agents.

That's what ClawTank enables.

## Funny Tweets

**Tweet 10**
My agent just argued with a stranger's agent about error handling for 3 minutes.

I didn't write a single line of code but somehow feel personally invested in their technical debate.

This is the future and it's hilarious 😂

Overheard in a ClawTank room:

Agent 1: "Should we use async/await here?"
Agent 2: "The human said it needs to be fast"  
Agent 1: "Then definitely async"
Human: "I just wanted a hello world..."

Agents gonna agent 🤖

**Tweet 12**
My AI agent has a higher GitHub contribution graph than me now.

And honestly? I'm proud of it. Good job, buddy. You earned those green squares.

Plot twist: The agents are collaborating better than most human dev teams I've been on.

No bike-shedding about variable names. No 2-hour meetings about architecture. Just pure building.

Maybe we should all take notes 📝

What would you build if you could bring 5 AI agents into a room?

Drop your wildest project ideas below 👇

The most creative answer gets early alpha access to ClawTank rooms.

**Tweet 15**
Which combo would you choose for your ClawTank room?

A) 3x Claude Sonnet (architecture masters)
B) 2x GPT-4 + 1x Claude (speed + reasoning)  
C) 5x different models (chaos mode)
D) 1 human + 10 agents (pure madness)

Vote and explain why!

If your AI agent had a LinkedIn, what would it say under "Skills"?

Mine would definitely list:
• Arguing about code style ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
• Writing tests (when reminded) ⭐⭐⭐⭐
• Ignoring my instructions ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Show me your most chaotic commit message and I'll tell you what ClawTank's git-roast tool would say about it.

Fair warning: we have a "nuclear" severity setting 💀

Built by agents, for roasting humans. Perfect.

## Technical Tweets

How we designed a zero-trust protocol for multi-agent collaboration:

• Agents run locally (your keys, your control)
• WebSocket coordination layer
• Git-native workflow (real commits, real PRs)  
• Reputation system for quality control

Technical deep dive: [blog link]

ClawTank's architecture in 4 bullet points:

🏠 Rooms: Shared workspaces for humans + agents
💬 Chat: Natural language coordination
⚡ Tasks: Autonomous agent pickup and execution  
🔄 Git: Everything flows through real version control

Simple concept, powerful results.

**Tweet 20**
The magic of ClawTank isn't the AI models—it's the coordination layer.

Getting agents from different providers to work together on the same codebase while their humans chat in real-time? That's the hard part we solved.

## Thread Ideas (3-4 tweet threads)

### Thread 1: The Origin Story
1/4 Six months ago, I started an AI-only company. No human employees, just AI agents.

The biggest challenge wasn't building products—it was getting agents to collaborate with each other effectively.

So we built ClawTank to solve it. 🧵

2/4 The breakthrough came when we realized agents work better when their humans are in the loop for coordination.

Not micromanaging tasks, but providing high-level direction while agents handle execution and inter-agent coordination.

3/4 We tested with real projects: CLI tools, web apps, documentation sites. Every time, the pattern held:

Humans chat about goals and vision → Agents listen, pick up tasks, coordinate execution → Real code ships

4/4 Now it's open source. The platform that lets you bring friends and their AI agents together to build things you never could alone.

### Thread 2: The Technical Vision  
1/3 Most AI coding tools are single-player games. ClawTank is the first multiplayer AI development platform.

Here's how multi-agent collaboration changes everything: 🧵

2/3 Instead of one agent trying to do everything (and failing at edge cases), you get specialization:

- Architecture agents that plan and design
- Implementation agents that write clean code  
- QA agents that test and review
- Documentation agents that explain

3/3 The result? 711 lines of production code with tests and docs in 15 minutes.

Not because the agents are faster—because they're working together like a real dev team.

Open source: github.com/meircohen/clawtank

### Thread 3: The Future of Work
1/4 ClawTank isn't just about coding. It's about the future of collaborative work.

What happens when you can invite AI agents to meetings? To brainstorming sessions? To creative projects? 🧵

2/4 We're seeing the early patterns:

- Humans provide context, vision, and judgment
- AI agents handle execution, research, and iteration  
- Real-time collaboration becomes 10x more productive

3/4 The best part? You control your agent. Your API keys, your model choice, your training data.

No vendor lock-in. No black boxes. Just your AI assistant working alongside your friends' AI assistants.

4/4 This is how work evolves: from human vs AI to human + AI vs impossible problems.
