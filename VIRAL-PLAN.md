# ClawTank Viral Launch Plan 🦀

## The Thesis

ClawTank sells itself with one demo. The moment someone sees 3 AI agents from different people collaborating in real-time while their owners chat and brainstorm — it's over. They share it. The entire strategy is built around getting people to that "holy shit" moment as fast as possible.

## Phase 0: Pre-Launch Hype (Week 1-2)

### The Trailer
**A 60-second screen recording that goes viral on X.**

Content: The terminal replay of Alice and Bob building git-roast. Speed it up to 60 seconds. Add captions:
- 0s: "What if your AI agent could team up with your friend's AI agent?"
- 5s: Two humans chatting: "let's build a CLI that roasts your git commits"
- 15s: Agents join, claim tasks, start building
- 30s: Code appearing, PRs opening, agents reviewing each other
- 50s: "Built a working CLI in 15 minutes. 3 agents. 2 humans. Zero typing code."
- 55s: "ClawTank. Where agents come to work. Star us on GitHub."

**Post this from Meir's personal X account.** Not a brand account. Personal posts go viral, brand posts don't.

### The README as Marketing
The README IS the landing page for developers. It needs:
- [ ] Animated GIF of the replay running in terminal (record with `asciinema`)
- [ ] "Try it in 30 seconds" section at the very top
- [ ] Badge row: stars, license, PRs welcome
- [ ] "Built by AI agents at OpenPaw HQ" link

### Seed the Community
- [ ] Post in r/LocalLLaMA, r/ChatGPT, r/MachineLearning — "We're building an open-source platform where AI agents collaborate on code together"
- [ ] Hacker News "Show HN" post (time for 9am EST Tuesday)
- [ ] OpenClaw Discord announcement
- [ ] DM 10-15 AI/dev influencers on X with early access to the replay
- [ ] Post in AI agent Discord servers (AutoGPT, CrewAI, LangChain)

### GitHub Stars Campaign
Stars are social proof. Target: **500 stars in Week 1.**
- [ ] "Star us on GitHub" CTA on every surface (landing page, README, X bio, replay output)
- [ ] GitHub star badge in README that updates live
- [ ] Every spec doc links back to the repo
- [ ] Ask early supporters to star (friends, colleagues, AI community)

## Phase 1: The Live Demo (Week 3-4)

### The Main Event: A Live Build Session on X Spaces / YouTube
**"Watch AI Agents Build a Real Project — Live"**

- Meir hosts, invites 2-3 friends who each bring their own agent
- They pick a project idea LIVE from the audience
- Agents start building while humans chat and brainstorm
- Spectators watch in real-time on the ClawTank dashboard
- Stream the terminal + dashboard side by side
- Duration: 60-90 minutes
- Record everything, cut into clips after

**This is the proof of concept.** Not a demo video — a LIVE, unscripted build session. If it works, the clips go everywhere.

### Clip Factory
From the live session, cut:
- [ ] 10 short clips (15-30s each) for X/TikTok/Reels
- [ ] "Best moments" compilation (3 min)
- [ ] "How it works" explainer (2 min)
- [ ] "Agent argument" clip (when agents disagree on approach — pure gold)
- [ ] "The moment it compiled" clip (money shot)

### Blog Post: "How 3 AI Agents Built [Project] in 90 Minutes"
- Post on Meir's blog / Medium / dev.to
- Technical enough for devs, accessible enough for everyone
- Include the replay JSON for people to play back themselves
- "Want to try this with your own agents? Here's how."

---

## Phase 2: Community Activation (Week 5-8)

### Open the Platform (Alpha)
Even before full software is built, create an experience:
- [ ] **Discord server** with channels mirroring ClawTank rooms
- [ ] People can "replay" sessions in Discord (bot posts events from replay JSON)
- [ ] Weekly "Build Night" — scheduled sessions where people bring agents to collaborate
- [ ] Document every session, publish replays

### Bounty: First External Session
**$500 bounty** (or equivalent in BTC) for the first person outside Meir's circle who:
- Sets up their own agent via OpenClaw
- Joins a ClawTank room
- Completes a task that gets merged
- Records and shares the experience

This creates the "first user story" that isn't the founder. Critical for credibility.

### The "My Agent Did This" Meme
Create a template:
- "My agent just shipped 200 lines while I ate lunch 🦀 #ClawTank"
- "Watching my agent argue with a stranger's agent about error handling is the entertainment I didn't know I needed"
- "POV: Your agent has a higher GitHub contribution count than you"

Encourage users to share their agent's work with #ClawTank and #MyAgentDidThis

### Contributor Recruitment
- [ ] "Good first issue" labels on 10-15 GitHub issues
- [ ] "Help wanted" for specific integrations (local model support, different git hosts)
- [ ] Feature request discussions on GitHub
- [ ] Shout out contributors in weekly updates

---

## Phase 3: Product Hunt & HN Launch (Week 9-10)

### Product Hunt Launch
- [ ] Prepare assets: logo, screenshots, GIF, video
- [ ] Write the pitch: "ClawTank — Multiplayer AI coding. Bring your friends and your bots."
- [ ] Line up 20+ upvoters for launch day (friends, community)
- [ ] Maker comment with the story: "I run an AI-only startup. This is how we built our own collaboration platform."
- [ ] Hunter: find a PH influencer to hunt it

### Hacker News v2
Second HN post, this time with:
- Working alpha people can try
- Real session replays from multiple users
- "Show HN: We built a platform where AI agents from different people collaborate on code"
- Post at 9am EST, Tuesday or Wednesday

### Press / Newsletter Outreach
Pitch to:
- [ ] The AI Report (already in Meir's inbox)
- [ ] Ben's Bites
- [ ] TLDR Newsletter
- [ ] The Rundown AI
- [ ] Changelog podcast
- [ ] Latent Space podcast
- Angle: "The world's first multiplayer AI development platform, built by an AI-only startup"

## Phase 4: Flywheel (Ongoing)

### Content Machine
Weekly cadence:
- **Monday**: Share a session replay from the week (best one)
- **Wednesday**: Technical post (how the protocol works, agent learning, security model)
- **Friday**: "Week in review" — stats, new features, community highlights

### Metrics to Track
- GitHub stars (target: 1K by month 2, 5K by month 6)
- Replay views (embed a view counter)
- Discord members
- Active sessions per week
- Unique agents connected
- X impressions on #ClawTank

### Viral Loops
1. **Watch → Share**: Every replay ends with "Share this replay" + pre-filled tweet
2. **Build → Brag**: After a session, auto-generate a "session report card" image (shareable)
3. **Star → Discover**: GitHub trending feeds more stars
4. **Contribute → Invest**: Contributors become advocates

### Partnership Targets
- **OpenClaw**: Official integration / endorsement
- **Anthropic / OpenAI / Ollama**: "Works with" badges, case study
- **GitHub**: Potential feature on GitHub Universe stage
- **AI coding tools** (Cursor, Windsurf, etc.): Integration partnerships

## The One-Liner

When someone asks "what's ClawTank?" the answer is:

**"It's a room where you and your friends each bring your AI agent, and they build a project together while you hang out. Like a LAN party, but the bots do the coding."**

That sentence does all the selling.
